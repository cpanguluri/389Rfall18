### Part 2 (75 pts)

Because of the colossal impact of this decision, I would discuss this with both my boss and trusted individuals first. Ideally, I would want to warn the public to stop the usage of this firmware. However, given that this is firmware, it would be very difficult to request users to stop using it because it is an essential part of many people’s work. This may in turn just cause mass panic and ineffective usage stopping. An argument against not bringing this issue to the public eye is that bad actors may already have found these vulnerabilities and are exploiting them during this time. This situation is similar to the FBI’s Operation Playpen where the agency had gained access over a popular child pornography website but did not take it down until 2 weeks later. They did this, so they could install malware on the viewers computers to make locating and indicting them easier, however this decision caused a continuation of the viewing of child pornography on the site. 
I would try to find a way to get these security issues resolved and bring it to the attention of the members in charge of organizing this. However, if I do not see any movement or decision made, I believe I would try releasing this information to the public. I believe that if I do not do anything to help improve this situation, I would be causing harm. It is similar to watching a person have a heart attack. If I do not call 911 or get help, the person may die. It is my responsibility to make sure I do as much as I can to make sure that does not happen. In a similar sense, knowing what I would know in the situation of the ECU, it would be my responsibility, as well as the responsibility of the others who know, to better this situation and cause the least harm to the victims.
