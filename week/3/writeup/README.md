Common Vulnerabilities

- Weak Passwords
	- Should not be using a password that is a popular word, or something that you are publicly interested in (it is predictable).
	- Publicly known information and posts made by a user on social media can give hints to their password and/or answers to security questions.
	- The longer and the more complicated the password the better. As mentioned by Edward Snowden when he was being interviewed by John Oliver, a common 8-letter password could take seconds to crack (http://time.com/3815620/edward-snowden-password-john-oliver/).
	- Recommend: having a long password with a mix of upper and lower case letters, numbers, and special characters. And can use password accounting websites like "Last Pass" to keep track of accounts paired with complicated passwords.

- Not Hiding IP Addresses
	- Should not leave IP addresses as ways to access websites (like the Admin page of cornerstoneairlines.com did)
	- Should register the domain name with that page
	- Recommend: Use a firewall like McAfee or WatchGuard to monitor traffic on the site and to hide and protect the internal network address. It would also help report on threats.

- Posting Sensitive Information on Social Media
	- The only way we could have gotten the right flag was because of the Instagram post with the flight number.
	- Malicious actors could use public information about a person to obtain sensitive information (ex. Social Engineering)
	- Example: What people post on social media can be great information for malicious actors when trying to break into a protected and private area. For example, while it is popular to keep location on and post pictures when traveling, burglars can see that as a hint that the house that the traveler resides in is vacant. It would be a perfect time to rob the house (https://abc7news.com/travel/burglars-use-social-media-to-find-next-victims/448107/) . Similarly, if sensitive information is posted online, malicious actors could use that to find passwords and figure out the answers to security questions (https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2015/06/01/irs-breach-personal-data-vulnerable/28068875/). 
	- Recommend: Do not post sensitive information publicly. Also, do not use professional emails for private accounts. Or else it would further	facilitate malicious actors in finding sensitive information using public knowledge.
