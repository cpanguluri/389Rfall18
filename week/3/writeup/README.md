Common Vulnerabilities

- Weak Passwords
	- One should not be using a password that is a popular word, or something that they are publicly interested in (the password becomes easier to guess).
	- Publicly known information and posts made by a user on social media can give hints to their password and/or answers to security questions.
	- The longer and the more complicated the password the better. As mentioned by Edward Snowden when he was being interviewed by John Oliver, a common 8-letter password could take seconds to crack (http://time.com/3815620/edward-snowden-password-john-oliver/).
	- Recommendation: Use long passwords with a mix of upper and lower case letters, numbers, and special characters. And use password accounting websites like "Last Pass" to keep track of accounts paired with complicated passwords.

- Not Hiding IP Addresses
	- One should not leave IP addresses as ways to access websites or on the address line (like the Admin page of cornerstoneairlines.com did).
	- An easily accessable IP Address facilitates an easier time locating a device or server.
	- Recommend: Use a firewall like McAfee or WatchGuard to monitor traffic on the site and to hide and protect the internal network address. It would also help report on threats. Using VPN (Virtual Private Network) would also be helpful in thwarting actors malicous actors as it helps mask the location of the device/server and encrypt data transfers.

- Posting Sensitive Information on Social Media
	- The only way we could have gotten the right flag was because of the Instagram post with the flight number. This is a clear example of how social media could help facilitate hacking. 
	- Malicious actors could use public information about a person to obtain sensitive information.
	- Example: What people post on social media can be great information for malicious actors when trying to break into a protected and private area. For example, while it is popular to keep location on and post pictures when traveling, burglars can see that as a hint a house is vacant and would be easy to rob. (https://abc7news.com/travel/burglars-use-social-media-to-find-next-victims/448107/) . Similarly, if sensitive information is posted online, malicious actors could use that to find passwords and figure out the answers to security questions (https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2015/06/01/irs-breach-personal-data-vulnerable/28068875/). 
	- Recommend: Do not post sensitive information publicly. Also, do not use professional emails for private accounts. Or else it would further	facilitate malicious actors in finding sensitive information using public knowledge.
